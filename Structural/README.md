# Structural Patterns

Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. They help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to do so. Here's a brief overview of common structural design patterns:

- **Adapter Pattern**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect, enabling classes to work together that couldn't otherwise due to incompatible interfaces.
- **Bridge Pattern**: Separates an object's abstraction from its implementation so that they can vary independently. It's useful when you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation, or when changes in the implementation should not affect clients.
- **Composite Pattern**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
- **Facade Pattern**: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
- **Flyweight Pattern**: Uses sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. It's useful when the cost of creating and maintaining objects is high and can help improve performance and conserve memory.
- **Proxy Pattern**: Provides a placeholder for another object to control access to it. It's useful when you want to add a level of indirection to support controlled access, lazy initialization, logging, or security.

Now, let's briefly discuss when to use each structural pattern:

- **Adapter Pattern**: Use when you need to adapt an existing class with a different interface to work with your code, or when integrating third-party libraries with incompatible interfaces.
- **Bridge Pattern**: Use when you want to separate an abstraction from its implementation to allow them to vary independently, or when you want to avoid a permanent binding between abstraction and implementation.
- **Composite Pattern**: Use when you want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects, treating individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Use when you want to add responsibilities to objects dynamically and transparently, or when subclassing is impractical or not feasible.
- **Facade Pattern**: Use when you want to provide a simplified interface to a complex system, hiding its complexity and making it easier to use.
- **Flyweight Pattern**: Use when you need to support a large number of fine-grained objects efficiently and want to reduce memory usage or improve performance.
- **Proxy Pattern**: Use when you want to control access to an object, add behavior before or after accessing it, or defer the creation of the object until it's actually needed.
